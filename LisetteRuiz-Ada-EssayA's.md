_1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?_
	
		An interest in magic, spells and witchcraft captured my imagination from a young age. I see programming as the manifestation of my fabled childhood dreams. I’m continually fascinated and inspired by the unimaginable possibilities of learning to write code. “The analytical engine can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths,” explained Ada Lovelace, 200 years before the modern computer was invented. Ada Developer Academy is a beautiful namesake in honour of this extraordinary women. My interest in programming has been largely self-taught to date, but I hope to continue learning  and broadening my understanding as a member of the next cohort. 

		As a teenager, Tumblr and similar blog platforms recaptured my imagination in what seemed like a new breed of magic. Although the HTML and CSS was basic, it was fascinating to experience a world through my computer screen. The idea that anyone can play a part in the future through programming is the most interesting aspect for me. I deeply regret not focusing on computer science and math more during my high school years, but in accepting that we all have different paths, I have found a new sense of purpose. With educational tools like Khan Academy, Free Code Camp, YouTube and books , I have made more progress than I ever thought possible. Learning to code is intimidating,  but it is easy to feel motivated when each new piece of information is like a piece of the puzzle falling into place.

		 I will be celebrating Ada Lovelace Day on October 11th this year, and sharing the important lessons she stands for. Conditions have gotten better for women in the past 200 years, but it is still difficult for girls to get the same attention as male counterparts in technology. I’m highly motivated to see a future where future generations will take programming from an esoteric pursuit, and reimagine it as something truly magical. 













_2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?_


		I am deeply inspired by the female founders I see forging unique career paths and leading companies built on the principle of ‘social enterprise’. These women are proving that the traditional, profit driven model for how business ‘should’ work is not the only successful model and that it is possible to use business as a tool for social good. If I am fortunate enough to get accepted to Ada Developers Academy, I plan to use the opportunity as a launchpad for a career that is dedicated to aiding economic development in underprivileged communities, through a business model which prioritizes social and environmental causes over maximizing economic gain. 


		Leila Janah, the founder of Sama Group, and Miki Agrawal, founder of THINX, are two role models for the trajectory I hope to see my future take. These two women are responsible for ‘social enterprise’ companies that have positive social and environmental change built into their core DNA. Sama Group is responsible for several different organizations which focus on helping people lift themselves out of poverty through digital work. An example being Samaschool, which trains low-income people in the U.S. to access digital work. THINX, a revolutionary ‘period panty’, is partnered with AFRIpads in Uganda which turns young woman into entrepreneurs by teaching them to make and sell reusable pads, which in turn allows them to earn an income and a means for staying in school. These founders, working with passionate developers, have revolutionized industries through a wholehearted effort to better the world. 

		Majora Carter is another role model for the type of career I aspire to have within the next five years. She is celebrated for her persistent work towards introducing an idea of ‘self-gentrification’ in South Bronx. As a native to the area, who grew up in the 70’s during a time in which poverty, addiction and violence devastated the community. Majora was unrelenting in her mission to get out of the Bronx. She was a smart, hard-working student who was told that her success would be measured by how far away she got. And she succeeded, using education as a path out of her troubled neighbourhood.This idea of smart young people leaving their rough communities in order to settle down in a new city or country is referred to as ‘brain-drain’. When Majora found herself back in the Bronx while attending graduate school at NYU, she decided to change her plans, stay and do something about the still dire living situations in South Bronx. From transforming a piece of land from a would be waste-transfer facility into a park, starting a company that hires local gamers to test software and opening a boutique coffee shop in the most unlikely neighbourhood, Majora is challenging every assumption of what is possible for a community that many had abandoned. 

		I was born in Havana, Cuba to parents that are an example of this phenomena referred to as ‘brain-drain’. They were bright, well-educated individuals with the misfortune of being born shortly after the U.S Embargo took action and then experiencing the euphemistically named, ‘Special Period’ in Cuban history. Referred to as ‘special’ because the rate and severity with which the small island fell into economic crisis after the dissolution of the Soviet Union was truly unlike anything that had ever been experienced before. Sever food shortages, rationing, lack of medical resources and overcrowding contributed to a culture of hopelessness. So, when my parents were given the opportunity to create a better life for their young family, they took the offer. I was one of the privileged few who immigrated to Canada while I was young, spared from a life of excruciating poverty. This sense of privilege fills me with gratitude, but also comes with an alarming sense of responsibility to give back to the country that holds my heritage and in which many of my family members still live.
	
		My dream career is one dedicated to inspiring a generation of people to rebuild Cuba. Starting that career as a developer, with guidance from the amazing people behind Ada, is the best possible catalyst for my goals. Programming teaches it’s students to think, solve problems, and create change in unique ways. The inclusive learning environment and opportunity for an internship, is the best way to empower myself as a developer and as a leader.My hope is that with a team of equally motivated people, we can rebuild a country through small acts of greatness and ensure their safety, security and liberty. 




	


	







_3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?_

	 Racism, sexism, classism and most every other social injustice plaguing the world today is made possible by a culture that teachers a fear of the unknown. I believe that the best tool we have for combating intolerance for all people is conversation. It is my goal to contribute to Ada’s vision by sharing my personal narrative and encouraging others to share their stories. Encouraging dialogue around topics like white privilege and the patriarchy as a collective community is the best tool for ensuring a  progressive, inclusive and diverse future.

	 Growing up as a Hispanic immigrant female in Eastern Canada, surrounded by mainly nuclear, white, middle-class families, there was a resistance in teachers and parents to talking about transgressive topics of identity. This willingness in adults to ignore the challenging topics was frustrating and did not spare me from experiencing the harsh realities associated with being perceived as ‘different’ from my peers. Instead, the lack of guidance at a young age, when we are most vulnerable, alienated me. Covering up my differences took precedent over learning to celebrate my individuality. As an adult, I feel lucky to have had the childhood I did. I have learned to love myself, and in doing that, love all my fellow humans for the hardships they too have experienced.  I hope to contribute to Ada’s vision by continuing to show compassion and accepting for my peers. 


	 Much like the traditionally male dominated tech industry, it is also common to see women marginalized within the music industry. Female performers don’t see the same respect as male counterparts and it is not uncommon for them to be dismissed as the male performers ‘girlfriend’. In an effort to develop my HTML, CSS & JavaScript skills  while contributing to a more inclusive and diverse community, I reached out to a badass group of ladies running a DJ workshop focused on creating safe spaces for women and LGBTQ+ folks. Started in Vancouver, BC, a city I called home last year, Intersessions has now expanded into Toronto, New York, London, Los Angeles and more. Diverse groups of students and teachers gather for classes where they learn about electronic music production, share their passions,  make friends and have fun. Plans for the website currently include an interactive calendar of upcoming events, a blog platform for guest curators, teachers and students to publish their content and a donation system to keep the program operational. Intersessions, much like Ada, is about creating a positive network of diverse people, who can come together to achieve their goals. 

	 Difficult, uncomfortable topics are typically some of the most obvious and crucial realities. People know that racism and sexism exists. It is apparent in classrooms where STEM fields are cultivated in young boys more than in young girls. We see it in the workplace when young men consistently get leadership roles, while young women are left to fill in the blanks. We see it in popular media when the confident prince swoops in to save the feeble princess. But it is so much easier to pretend like those realities, are not our realities. Ada’s Developers Academy is taking a stand against discrimination in the workplace through education and community engagement. I would be immensely proud to contribute to the widespread positivity made possible my Ada. 








_4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?_

	
		To date, I have accumulated an impressive set of skills such as french-braiding and pouring the perfect milk to cereal ratio. However, speaking fluent Italian is not amongst my many impressive skills. Considering I lived in Italy for eight months, I have to admit to myself that I made a mistake during my time abroad in failing to learn a new language. My mistake was thinking that I was a failure, before I even started. As banal a platitude as it is, the reality is that I failed because I never tried. 


		In retrospect, I see my reason’s for not learning more Italian, but my inner voice also knows that my reasons are cop-outs. I had an opportunity to learn a new language and m own decisions hindered my progress. If I could go back and relive my time abroad, I would encourage myself to take more risks. I’d ask for my coffee in choppy Italian, unapologetically and make small talk with everyone I encountered in public. I would prioritize trying and making mistakes over being perfect.

	
		My application for Ada has been a step towards demonstrating to myself that I have learned my lesson. The essay portion of the application asks very difficult questions. Answering them honestly calls for a degree of bravery and self-awareness. Learning to upload my resume in markdown as a Gist was it’s own type of challenge too. The saying “ if you ask for patience, what you get is a line at the bank” should be updated to “ if you ask for patience, what you get is GitHub”. The technical questions again, were challenging in their nature but also in my ability to persevere. I am proud to have worked hard and applied because at the end of the day, even if I am not a good fit for Ada, I can rest assured that I didn’t fail to try. 


		Although I don’t have plans to return to Milan and redo those months of intensive language practice, I do have a chance now to dive headfirst into a new type of language. What I should have done with Italian and what I am determined to do wth programming , is remind myself that it is okay to start small. To figure it out as you go along and to expect mistakes along the way.
